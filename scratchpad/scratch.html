    <h1>Salt's Scratchpad</h1>
    <p>The purpose of the scratchpad is to record and annotate useful code.</p>
    <p>I'm already pretty familiar with <a href="google.com"><samp>a href</samp></a> but it doesn't hurt to put it down
        here anyway.</p>
    <figure>
        <!-- The <figure> element is responsible for the slight indentation of the
    image which it contains. You can use <figure> not just for photos, diagrams,
    and other images, but for code listings and anything else that you'd like to
    keep self-contained. The position of the <figure> element is related to but
    independent of the main flow of the document. -->

                alt="This alt text has been displayed because the `src` attribute has a typo. Good alt text will be tweetishly short and not state `image of` or `photo of.` Search engines will read alt text.">

        <figcaption>The <samp>figcaption</samp> tag defines a caption for photos. Because these images are contained
            within the same <samp>&ltfigure&gt</samp> element, they also share a caption. It's worth checking out <a
                href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/images-and-media">Harvard's Digital Accessibility page</a>
            and <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/designers/#infographic">WebAIM's Accessibility page</a> in order
            to build these properly.</figcaption>
