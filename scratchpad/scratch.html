    <h1>Salt's Scratchpad</h1>
    <p>The purpose of the scratchpad is to record and annotate useful code.</p>
    <p>I'm already pretty familiar with <a href="google.com"><samp>a href</samp></a> but it doesn't hurt to put it down
        here anyway.</p>
    <figure>
        <!-- The <figure> element is responsible for the slight indentation of the
    image which it contains. You can use <figure> not just for photos, diagrams,
    and other images, but for code listings and anything else that you'd like to
    keep self-contained. The position of the <figure> element is related to but
    independent of the main flow of the document. -->

        <figcaption>The <samp>figcaption</samp> tag defines a caption for photos. Because these images are contained
            within the same <samp>&ltfigure&gt</samp> element, they also share a caption. It's worth checking out <a
                href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/images-and-media">Harvard's Digital Accessibility page</a>
            and <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/designers/#infographic">WebAIM's Accessibility page</a> in order
            to build these properly.</figcaption>

    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p><samp>( = )</samp> is an assignment operator, which assigns values to variables. <samp>( == )</samp> is a loose equality operator, which will attempt to convert and compare operands of different types. <samp>( === )</samp> is a strict equality operator that compares two operands and checks whether both value and type are equal. <samp>( != )</samp> is a loose inequality operator, and <samp>( !== )</samp> is a strict inequality operator.</p>
    <p>Comparison operators (like those above and those to come) can return either <samp>true</samp> or <samp>false</samp>. The operator <samp>===</samp> means "equal value and equal type." The operator <samp>!==</samp> means "not equal value or not equal type." When using "greater (or lesser) than or equal" the operators <samp>&gt=</samp> and <samp>&lt=</samp> should be used, with the equals sign on the right-hand side.</p>
    <p><samp>( ! )</samp> reverses the value of a boolean. <samp>( && )</samp> returns <samp>true</samp> iff (not a typo) the operands are true. <samp>( || )</samp> returns <samp>true</samp> if at least one of the operations is true.</p>
    <h1>APIs</h1>
    <p>Effective use of APIs is an important component of work with Javascript, so they deserve their own section.</p>
