    package.json is like cdn but you don't need it in your html page.

    Do not push up node modules to GitHub! Any time that you use npm i, it'll
    download all the packages listed in your dependencies, so you need
    "node_modules" in your gitignore. If you pull down code from GitHub and
    somebody's applied a new module, you'll npm install those modules.

    index.html file needs to point to main.js, not to index.js, e.g.
    src="./main.js", because the main.js will have vanilla js but the index.js
    will have react, which html doesn't know how to read. 

        touch gitignore
        npm init    //  Creates package.json
        npm install //  
        npm i react react-dom babel-loader @babel/preset-react webpack 
        apply (in package.json) "webpack --mode=development" //  gets rid of "at least two configs are needed" warning
            ^ in the package.json ^
        npm run build
            now you should have f. folders: dist (main.js); node_modules; src (index.js).
            now you should have f. files: gitignore; package-lock.json; package.json; webpack.config.js. 

        now you can use import { } 
            e.g.    import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
        now you can write createRoot, and not ReactDOM.createRoot
            e.g.    const container = document.querySelector(`root`);
                    const root = createRoot()

    Create header.js, name it the same as the component 
        import React etc. 
        const Header = () => {
            return (
                <>
                    <a href="google.com">Google<a/>
                    <a href="facebook.com">Facebook</a>
                    <a href="myspace.com">MySpace</a>
                </>
            )
        }
        export default Header // you need to have a default when you export. 

        in index.js
            import Header from "./Header.js";

            npm create vite@latest
            upon running, will ask "what is your project name?" 
            react
            javascript
            follow directions
                cd [project name]
                npm install
                npm run dev
            you'll need a split terminal when you're running vite. 

            if 404 error, make sure using correct localhost
