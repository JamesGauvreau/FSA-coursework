// Extra (optional): Display a dialog box that gives the sum of all three
// numbers.

// Even more extra: Research to find out how you can check if the input number
// is valid. For example “Tuna” is not a valid number, but “3” is. If the input
// is invalid display a dialog box to the user. This will require knowledge from
// tomorrow’s lecture, but if you are finished early this will be good pre-work
// to get you ready. Look into javascript conditionals.
